<h2>What is a SparkCloud?</h2>
<p>
  A SparkCloud is a tag cloud with spark lines incorporated along with
  the texts. It was a result of a Microsoft Research conducted by four women,
  namely: Bongshin Lee,Nathalie Henry Riche, Amy K. Karlson, Sheelagh
  Carpendale. The purpose of SparkClouds is to let people see how tag clouds
  change over time.
</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
  SparkClouds, like all other visualizations, have pros and cons.
</p>
<p>
  SparkClouds let users compare multiple tag clouds without having to see them separately.
  They make it convinient to see how text samples change over time.
  SparkClouds make the visulization compact and less cluttered compared to
  alternatives. Scrolling is usually not necessary, and everything can be made to fit in a screen.
  Identifying words is fast, and users can easily get a big picture of the data without interaction.
  Finally, color could also be used in the visualization to encode other things.
</p>
<p>
  Some cons include the lack x-axis labels, which forces
  users to guess which time period (e.g. month) is represented.
  The y-axis is normalized for each word, which makes it difficult to compare frequency between words (except by size of word, which is less precise).
  Position in space is not used as an attribute in SparkClouds. The position of a text on the screen means nothing, which means we're
  not using the most powerful visual variable. Long words might get more attention than short words of same frequency, which might let give have a slightly wrong
  impression about the data.
  Accessing details in the data might interaction, and finally, SparkClouds are a very specific type of visualization, which can only be used for word-based or tag-based datasets.
</p>
<p>
  While SparkClouds are good for seeing trends in a tag-based dataset over time, they're not great for diving into details about the dataset. One particular example of when SparkClouds would
  be very useful is comparing State of the Union addresses over the years and seeing how the most frequently used words have changed over time. This gives us a big picture of how the
  speeches might have changed to reflect time era, presidents and policies.
