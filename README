Repository for our presentation on SparkClouds.
Aayam Poudel and Jamie Hand

Our process:

1. Got text of State of the Union addresses from 2001 to 2016
and put them into .txt files.

2. Wrote a python script to strip new lines and punctuation,
extract each word, count how many times it appears, and get
the top 25 words for that year (excluding stop words like
"the", "a", "I", and "can").

3. Output these words, counts, and years to a CSV file, and
combined the CSV files into a single file.

4. Wrote an HTML page with a demo, showing a SparkCloud that
takes in the CSV as data.
